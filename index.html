    <h1>Worthless Piece</h1>
    <p>You worthless piece of shit who cant be discplined more than a week
    .What the heck are you going to acheive in your life idiot.
    How many more times will you slip from this stupid alpha mode.
    I dont get the point why the hell are you not involved in that.
    Just go out there and try to be disciplined idiot.
    There are things which will distract you forever.
    But its your fight, you need to win.
    Please dont slip up again.

    </p>
     <p>You feel so anxious and stupid after that silly slipup.
         Why the hell are you slipping up.
         I dont get the reason.
         Please idiot, dont slip up again.
         Atleast stay sober in Feb from now on.
    </p>
